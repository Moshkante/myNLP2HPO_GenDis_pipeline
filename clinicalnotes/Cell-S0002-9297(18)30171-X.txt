The proband was born to a non-consanguineous couple, who had an unremarkable pregnancy history; however, at birth a large fontanel was reported. 
Parents and siblings were healthy and no significant family history was reported (Figure 1). 
The proband met all developmental milestones, except crawling, up to his first epileptic episode, which occurred at three years of age. 
After this episode, he lost all speech, began exhibiting autistic behavior, and also started to have frequent generalized tonic-clonic seizures. 
Over time, tonic, atonic, mild clonic, complex partial, myoclonic and gelastic seizures were reported in the proband.  
Other developmental skills, including throwing a ball, responding to his name, feeding himself with utensils and self-care skills were lost by 4-years of age. 
No significant conductive hearing loss, heart abnormalities or delayed bone age were found in the proband at that age. 
The proband was evaluated (by G.J.L.) at eleven years of age. 
He presented with several neurological and craniofacial abnormalities including epilepsy, ventriculomegaly, relative macrocephaly, prominent forehead, low hairline, thick eyebrows, wide-set eyes, macrodontia of upper central incisors, and full lips. 
Hand and foot abnormalities included clinodactyly of the fifth digit, bilateral single transverse palmar creases, brachydactyly and flat feet (Figure 2). 
He alsohad a diagnosis of cerebral folate deficiency due to the presence of folate receptor autoantibodies.
