A 60‐year‐old man with risk factors of alcohol use and 80 pack‐year (PY) smoking history presented with a 4 month history of hoarseness which progressed to intermittent dry cough, dysphagia, weight loss, and an expanding left‐sided neck mass. 
During that time, he also noticed dryness, flaking, and thickening of his fingernails, hands, feet, and ears with an associated constant severe burning and itching of those areas, worsened by stress or fatigue. 
These skin findings were diagnosed by a dermatologist as eczema and treated with oral Benadryl, topical Benadryl, and topical hydrocortisone. 
When the skin findings failed to improve, they were attributed to possibly a separate medication reaction. 
The neck mass was eventually biopsied by an Otolaryngologist utilizing endoscopy to visualize the lesion and pathology revealed a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
At presentation to oncology clinic, physical examination revealed bilateral lymphadenopathy with a prominent left‐sided 4 × 5 cm fixed mass at level III/IV. 
His dermatologic examination findings (Figure 1) included bilateral fingernail and toenail dystrophy, extreme dryness, and hyperkeratosis of the hands and feet, as well as similar findings on both ear helices, mildly on the nose, along with numbness of those affected areas. 
Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) confirmed known physical examination findings, along with increased uptake in the bilateral axillary, right infraclavicular, and mediastinal lymph nodes concerning for metastatic disease.
