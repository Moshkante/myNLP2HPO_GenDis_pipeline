A 7‐month‐old girl who was the first child of first‐degree consanguineous Saudi parents was referred to genetic division clinic for developmental delay evaluation. 
She was born at term by spontaneous vaginal delivery, and her birth weight was 3 kg. 
The mother is a healthy 27‐year‐old primigravida, and the father is a healthy 32‐year‐old. 
The pregnancy, antenatal and perinatal courses were unremarkable with no reported exposure to teratogens. 
She was growing well until the age of 3 months, when she started to have recurrent chest infection associated with stridor, poor sucking, frequent choking, failure to thrive, hypotonia, hypoglycemia, and chronic constipation.
On examination, the child looked alert, hypoactive, and malnourished. 
Her length was 60 cm (<3rd percentile), her weight was 4.2 kg (<3rd percentile), and her head circumference was 40 cm (<3rd percentile). 
Her eye examination was normal, and a neurological examination revealed generalized hypotonia with hyporeflexia and an unremarkable systemic examination. 
Her developmental assessment showed an inability to sit with support, head lag, she could not turn from the supine to prone position, and she could not hold objects, but she could follow objects with both eyes.
